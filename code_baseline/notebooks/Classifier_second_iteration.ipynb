This may have implications for the organisation and financing of rail passenger services provided under a public service contract. Member States may introduce in their legislation the possibility to deny access to the infrastructure where the economic equilibrium of such public service contracts would be compromised by new open access rail passenger services.\\n\\n                  \\n\\n\\n         \\t\\n                     (2)\\n\\n                  \\t\\n                     On the other hand, such services, depending on their specific features, such as quality characteristics, timing, destinations served and prospective customers targeted, may not be in head-on competition with public services, and thus cause only limited impact on the economic equilibrium of a public service contract. Furthermore, there may be positive network effects for public service operators, net benefits to passengers or wider social benefits that should be taken into account.\\n\\n                  \\n\\n\\n         \\t\\n                     (3)\\n\\n                  \\t\\n                     It is therefore necessary to balance the legitimate interests of operators performing a public service contract and competent authorities, on the one hand, with the overarching objectives of completing the single European railway area and reaping its wider social benefits, on the other hand. The economic equilibrium test should achieve a balance between those competing interests.\\n\\n                  \\n\\n\\n         \\t\\n                     (4)\\n\\n                  \\t\\n                     Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council\\xa0(3) lays down that, as a reward for discharging public service obligations in the provision of rail passenger services, operators may be granted financial compensation or exclusive rights, or both. However, the grant of exclusive rights to railway operators should not result in the foreclosure of domestic rail passenger markets.\\n\\n                  \\n\\n\\n         \\t\\n                     (5)\\n\\n                  \\t\\n                     Such exclusive rights should not preclude the right of access of other railway undertakings, unless the economic equilibrium test shows that, taking into account the value of the exclusive rights, the new rail passenger service would have a substantial negative impact on the profitability of services operated under the public service contract or the net cost of their provision for the competent authority, or both, depending on risk-sharing arrangements stipulated in the public service contract.\\n\\n                  \\n\\n\\n         \\t\\n                     (6)\\n\\n                  \\t\\n                     An economic equilibrium test should be requested only in respect of passenger rail services which are not provided under a public service contract and which are either entirely new or entail a substantial modification of an existing service.

The suspension should last for no longer than 12 months from the receipt of the applicant's notification or until the tender process has concluded, whichever is sooner.\\n\\n                     These specific provisions are without prejudice to the application of this regulation to a public service contract which is on-going at the time the applicant's notification is received. In these circumstances, and where the economic equilibrium test on the existing public service contract demonstrates that access can be granted, such access should be time-limited until the expiry of the existing public service contract.\\n\\n                  \\n\\n\\n         \\t\\n                     (14)\\n\\n                  \\t\\n                     The economic equilibrium of a public service contract should be regarded as compromised if the proposed new service would have a substantial negative impact on the level of profit for the public service operator and/or their operation would imply a substantial increase in net cost for the competent authority.\\n\\n                  \\n\\n\\n         \\t\\n                     (15)\\n\\n                  \\t\\n                     When assessing whether an impact is substantial, the regulatory body should take into account criteria such as whether the new service would jeopardise the viability and endanger the continuity of the public service, either because performance of the public contract would not be economically sustainable for the public service operator, or because it would entail a substantial increase in net cost for the competent authority.\\n\\n                  \\n\\n\\n         \\t\\n                     (16)\\n\\n                  \\t\\n                     Beyond the economic analysis, the regulatory body should also assess and take into account the net benefits to customers in the short and medium term and any impacts in network performance and capacity use. The regulatory body should take into account the technical information provided by the infrastructure manager on relevant infrastructure requirements, on expected impacts on network performance and on optimal capacity utilisation by all applicants.\\n\\n                  \\n\\n\\n         \\t\\n                     (17)\\n\\n                  \\t\\n                     The economic analysis should focus on the impact of the proposed new service on the public service contract as a whole, including the services specifically affected, for its entire time-scale, taking into account the value of any existing exclusive rights that may have been granted. No predefined quantified threshold regarding the damage should be applied strictly or in isolation, and no such thresholds should be set in national legislation. The assessment should be based on an objective methodology adopted by the regulatory body having regard to the specificities of rail transport in the Member State concerned.\\n\\n                  \\n\\n\\n         \\t\\n                     (18)\\n\\n                  \\t\\n                     When the regulatory body comes to the conclusion that the new rail passenger service would compromise the economic equilibrium of the public service contract, in its decision it should indicate, if relevant, possible changes to the new rail passenger service which would enable access to be granted. The regulatory body may issue recommendations to the competent authority as regards other possible conditions that would enable access to be granted, in particular in the light of its analysis of net benefits to customers arising from the new rail passenger service.\\n\\n                  \\n\\n\\n         \\t\\n                     (19)\\n\\n                  \\t\\n                     If the application for access concerns a new rail passenger service as defined in Article 3(36) of Directive 2012/34/EU and the objective economic analysis of the regulatory body shows that the new passenger service would have a substantial negative impact on the economic equilibrium of a public service contract, the regulatory body should determine conditions which would enable access to be granted in accordance with Article 11a of Directive 2012/34/EU.\\n\\n                  \\n\\n\\n         \\t\\n                     (20)\\n\\n                  \\t\\n                     In all its activities related to the economic equilibrium test, the regulatory body should not disclose confidential or commercially sensitive information received from the parties.\\xa0In particular, it should redact such information from the decision to be published.
