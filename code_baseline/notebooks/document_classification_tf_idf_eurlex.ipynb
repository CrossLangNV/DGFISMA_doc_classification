      "In order to enhance the consistency and comparability of nonfinancial information disclosed throughout the Union certain large undertakings should prepare a nonfinancial statement containing information relating to at least environmental matters social and employeerelated matters respect for human rights anticorruption and bribery matters Such statement should include a description of the policies outcomes and risks related to those matters and should be included in the management report of the undertaking concerned The nonfinancial statement should also include information on the due diligence processes implemented by the undertaking also regarding where relevant and proportionate its supply and subcontracting chains in order to identify prevent and mitigate existing and potential adverse impacts It should be possible for Member States to exempt undertakings which are subject to this Directive from the obligation to prepare a nonfinancial statement when a separate report corresponding to the same financial year and covering the same content is provided\n",

      "\n",
      "In providing this information undertakings which are subject to this Directive may rely on national frameworks Unionbased frameworks such as the EcoManagement and Audit Scheme EMAS or international frameworks such as the United Nations UN Global Compact the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights implementing the UN ‘Protect Respect and Remedy’ Framework the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises the International Organisation for Standardisations ISO  the International Labour Organisations Tripartite Declaration of principles concerning multinational enterprises and social policy the Global Reporting Initiative or other recognised international frameworks\n",

      "\n",
      "The scope of those nonfinancial disclosure requirements should be defined by reference to the average number of employees balance sheet total and net turnover SMEs should be exempted from additional requirements and the obligation to disclose a nonfinancial statement should apply only to those large undertakings which are publicinterest entities and to those publicinterest entities which are parent undertakings of a large group in each case having an average number of employees in excess of  in the case of a group on a consolidated basis This should not prevent Member States from requiring disclosure of nonfinancial information from undertakings and groups other than undertakings which are subject to this Directive\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the undertakings which fall within the scope of Directive EU of the European Parliament and of the Council  are members of groups of undertakings Consolidated management reports should be drawn up so that the information concerning such groups of undertakings may be conveyed to members and third parties National law governing consolidated management reports should therefore be coordinated in order to achieve the objectives of comparability and consistency of the information which undertakings should publish within the Union\n",

      "Statutory auditors and audit firms should only check that the nonfinancial statement or the separate report has been provided In addition it should be possible for Member States to require that the information included in the nonfinancial statement or in the separate report be verified by an independent assurance services provider\n",
      "\n",
      "With a view to facilitating the disclosure of nonfinancial information by undertakings the Commission should prepare nonbinding guidelines including general and sectoral nonfinancial key performance indicators The Commission should take into account current best practices international developments and the results of related Union initiatives The Commission should carry out appropriate consultations including with relevant stakeholders When referring to environmental aspects the Commission should cover at least land use water use greenhouse gas emissions and the use of materials\n",
      "\n",
      "Diversity of competences and views of the members of administrative management and supervisory bodies of undertakings facilitates a good understanding of the business organisation and affairs of the undertaking concerned It enables members of those bodies to constructively challenge the management decisions and to be more open to innovative ideas addressing the similarity of views of members also known as the ‘groupthink’ phenomenon It contributes thus to effective oversight of the management and to successful governance of the undertaking It is therefore important to enhance transparency regarding the diversity policy applied This would inform the market of corporate governance practices and thus put indirect pressure on undertakings to have more diversified boards\n",
      "\n",
      "The obligation to disclose diversity policies in relation to the administrative management and supervisory bodies with regard to aspects such as for instance age gender or educational and professional backgrounds should apply only to certain large undertakings Disclosure of the diversity policy should be part of the corporate governance statement as laid down by Article  of Directive EU If no diversity policy is applied there should not be any obligation to put one in place but the corporate governance statement should include a clear explanation as to why this is the case\n",

      "\n",
      "Since the objective of this Directive namely to increase the relevance consistency and comparability of information disclosed by certain large undertakings and groups across the Union cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather by reason of its effect be better achieved at Union level the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article  of the Treaty on European Union In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective\n",

The European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter the Authority) concludes in its opinion of 21 October 2008 (11) that Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC Sc47, as produced by the applicant Société Industrielle Lesaffre, can be presumed safe for the target species, consumers and the wider environment. In addition, it concludes that its use with dairy buffaloes is not expected to introduce any additional hazards for users. According to that opinion, that preparation can produce a significant effect on increasing milk protein content and its use does not have any treatment-related adverse effects on this additional animal category. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n",

      "THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n",
      "Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\n",
      "Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (1), and in particular Article 11(15) thereof,\n",
      "Whereas:\n",
      "(1)\n",
      "Article 11(15) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 has been amended by Article 42(3) of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2). That amendment was made to ensure that, with regard to the margin requirements for non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives, derivatives associated with covered bonds and derivatives associated with securitisations are treated in the same manner. Since Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/2251 (3) is based on Article 11(15) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, that Delegated Regulation should be amended to reflect the amendment made to Article 11(15) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and thus to include rules on the risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivative contracts not cleared by a central counterparty concluded by a securitisation special purpose entity in connection with a securitisation.\n",
      "(2)\n",
      "In accordance with the amended Article 11(15) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, such rules on the risk-mitigation techniques for OTC derivative contracts not cleared by a central counterparty and concluded by a securitisation special purpose entity in connection with a securitisation should take account of the impediments faced by those securitisation special purpose entities in providing collateral. Because securitisation special purpose entities are usually structured to generate little excess of liquidity, they have less assets to be used for the exchange of collateral. That impediment prevents securitisation special purpose entities from exchanging collateral in a way that fully complies with the requirements of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/2251. Therefore, under a specific set of conditions securitisation special purpose entities in connection with a Simple, Transparent and Standardised (‘STS’) securitisation should not be required to post collateral. This should allow securitisation special purpose entities in connection with an STS securitisation some flexibility, while ensuring that the risks for their counterparties are limited. However, there are no constraints on securitisation special purpose entities in connection with an STS securitisation to collect collateral from their counterparties and to subsequently return it when due. Counterparties of securitisation special purpose entities in connection with an STS securitisation are therefore required to post variation margin in cash. They should have the right to receive back part or all of it, while securitisation special purpose entities should only be required to collect the variation margin received in cash and to post variation margin for the amount in cash received. This is in line with recital 41 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 which refers to the need to ensure consistency in treatment between derivatives associated with covered bonds and derivatives associated with securitisations, with regard to the clearing obligation and to the margin requirements on non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives.\n",
