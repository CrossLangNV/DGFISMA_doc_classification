This paper brings together practice and techniques currently employed by major international banks in a single analytical framework. While no bank may follow this framework precisely, it is a model which is believed to be an example of current sound management practice and which could provide useful guidance to all banks.\"\n",

In general, the respondents supported the FSB's efforts to address the potential risks posed by other shadow banking entities based on the five economic functions, but asked for closer coordination among the different shadow banking workstreams as well as with other regulatory initiatives, and for clearer definitions and more precision for the policy toolkits for the five economic functions before they could be applied.\"\n",

An appropriate risk appetite framework (RAF) should enable risk capacity, risk appetite, risk limits, and risk profile to be considered for business lines and legal entities as relevant, and within the group context. The FSB Principles are high level to allow financial institutions to develop an effective RAF that is institution-specific and reflects its business model and organisation, as well as to enable financial institutions to adapt to the changing economic and regulatory environment in order to manage new types of risk. Establishing an effective RAF helps to reinforce a strong risk culture at financial institutions, which in turn is critical to sound risk management.\"\n",

      "        \"IntroductionIn its Consultative Paper on a New Capital Adequacy Frameworkof 3 June 1999, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Committee) stated its plans to refine its approach to the treatment of credit risk mitigation techniques in the banking book. The Committee is looking to develop a more consistent and economic approach to these techniques, covering collateral, guarantees, credit derivatives and on-balance sheet netting.The Committee acknowledges the benefits that can accrue from the use of credit risk mitigation techniques and the key role they can play in prudent risk management. The Committee also acknowledges the impact that regulatory requirements may have on market practices. Accordingly, the Committee believes it is important that the capital framework should afford a better recognition of risk mitigation techniques, reflecting the significant increase in recent years in the use and range of such techniques, as well as in the ability to manage the associated risks.The Capital Group (the Group) of the Committee prepared a paper (\\\"Issues related to Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques\\\"1) as a basis for discussion between the bank supervisors of the G10 countries and over 50 banks and industry associations within their jurisdiction. The purpose of the paper was to seek information on how credit risk mitigation techniques are used within risk management systems and to elicit some initial thoughts on the issues discussed in the Consultative Paper. Discussions were held with a cross-section of banks, including large internationally active banks with complex businesses and small domestic banks that primarily focus on traditional banking activities.2This document provides a summary of the views expressed by the banks surveyed and is intended to prompt further discussions on the topic with the industry.The summary is divided into two main sections. The first section covers general points on the use of credit risk mitigation techniques by banks and their treatment under the Accord. The second section discusses individual topics such as residual risks (i.e. risks arising from maturity mismatches, market price changes and asset mismatches), the extent of risk reduction, and issues relating to individual credit risk mitigation techniques (collateral, guarantees and on-balance sheet netting). The Group welcomes further comments on current bank practice and further suggestions for changes to the Accord.1The contents of the issues paper are included in this document.2The present Capital Accord and the proposed new framework are both targeted at internationally active banks. However, the Committee acknowledges that many countries apply the Capital Accord, in some form or another, to domestic banks. The objectives for the new framework state that the Accord \\\"should be suitable for application to banks of varying levels of complexity and sophistication\\\". \"\n",

The Committee will shortly publish general principles for the management of credit risk. This paper should be seen as complementary to that effort, and is a response to the specific challenges posed by credit risk emanating from interactions with HLIs. The Committee's review of banks' dealings with HLIs has revealed that in many cases there has not been an appropriate balance among the key elements of the credit risk management process, with an over reliance on collateralisation of mark-to-market exposures. Insufficient weight was placed on in-depth credit analyses of the HLI counterparties involved and the effective measurement and management of exposures. Moreover, in some cases, competitive forces and the desire to conduct business with certain counterparties may have led banks to make exceptions to their firm-wide credit standards.\"\n",

      "        \"Note: This document has been superseded by its revised version of February 2006.Please find attached a paper issued today by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision that provides guidance on corporate governance in banks. This paper forms part of an ongoing effort by the Committee to strengthen procedures for risk management and disclosure in banks. It is being circulated to supervisors around the world in the belief that it will assist in promoting the adoption of sound corporate governance practices as they implement the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. The Committee believes that through sound corporate governance, bank supervisors can have a collaborative working relationship with bank management, rather than an adversarial one.The paper draws on supervisory experience with corporate governance problems at banking organisations and suggests the types of practices that could help to avoid such problems. It identifies a number of practices as critical elements of any corporate governance process:Establishing strategic objectives and a set of corporate values that are communicated throughout the banking organisation;Setting and enforcing clear lines of responsibility and accountability throughout the organisation;Ensuring that board members are qualified for their positions, have a clear understanding of their role in corporate governance and are not subject to undue influence from management or outside concerns;Ensuring that there is appropriate oversight by senior management;Effectively utilising the work conducted by internal and external auditors, in recognition of the important control function they provide;Ensuring that compensation approaches are consistent with the bank's ethical values, objectives, strategy and control environment;Conducting corporate governance in a transparent manner.The paper is not being issued formally for consultation, but if you have strong views our Risk Management Group would be pleased to receive them.\"\n",

      "        \"This report sets out 14 policy recommendations to address the following structural vulnerabilities from asset management activities that could potentially present financial stability risks:  liquidity mismatch between fund investments and redemption terms and conditions for open-ended fund units; leverage within investment funds; operational risk and challenges at asset managers in stressed conditions; and securities lending activities of asset managers and funds.  Asset management activities have increased significantly over the past decade, including through open-ended funds that offer daily redemptions to their investors. Such growth has been accompanied by increased investment in particular asset classes, which encompass some less actively traded markets. The trend towards greater market-based intermediation through asset management entities should enhance the efficiency, and contribute to the overall resilience, of the financial system. While historical evidence suggests that open-ended funds generally have not created financial stability concerns in recent periods of stress, growth in the sector and increasing holdings of less liquid assets by investment funds suggest that risks may have increased in recent years. In the area of liquidity mismatch, the recommendations are designed to increase information and transparency to both authorities and investors with respect to open-ended funds as well as to strengthen liquidity risk management frameworks and practices of those funds. They also address the potential use of system-wide stress testing by authorities. Leverage recommendations focus on the measurement and monitoring of leverage within investment funds. The recommendation on operational risk would help ensure risk management frameworks and practices are commensurate with the level of risks that an asset manager\\u2019s activities pose to the financial system. The securities lending recommendation focuses on situations where indemnifications are provided by asset managers to their clients in relation to securities lending activities. The FSB published proposed policy recommendations for public consultation in June 2016. The final recommendations in this document reflect a number of changes to the proposed recommendations to incorporate responses to the consultation. Among other things, the recommendations on liquidity have been revised to encourage authorities to develop consistent reporting requirements, to better distinguish the information that is useful to authorities and investors, and to emphasise the exploratory nature of system-wide stress testing at this time. The purposes and uses of leverage measures have been clarified.\\u00a0 Some of the recommendations will be operationalised by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). IOSCO has been asked to complete its work on the liquidity recommendations by the end of 2017 and on leverage measures by the end of 2018. The FSB will regularly review progress in the operationalisation and implementation of the recommendations.\"\n",

The roadmap consists of two tracks:\\u00a0  Work to reduce mechanistic reliance on CRA ratings through standards, laws and regulations.\\u00a0 Work by authorities to promote and, where needed, require that financial institutions\\u00a0strengthen and disclose information on their own credit risk assessment approaches as a replacement for mechanistic reliance on CRA ratings.  These two tracks will need to progress in parallel, since changes in rules are needed to provide the incentive for market participants to develop their own credit risk assessments, while at the same time mechanistic reliance can only be safely ended if market participants have developed such assessment capacity.\"\n",

On 15 October 2014, the FSB adopted additional guidance that elaborates on specific Key Attributes\\u00a0relating to information sharing for resolution purposes and sector-specific guidance that sets out how the Key Attributes should be applied for insurers, financial market infrastructures (FMIs) and the protection of client assets in resolution. The newly adopted guidance documents have been incorporated as annexes into the 2014 version of the Key Attributes document. No changes were made to the text of the twelve Key Attributes of October 2011. The twelve Key Attributes remain the umbrella standard for resolution regimes covering financial institutions of all types that could be systemic in failure. The FSB will continue its work to develop further guidance as needed to promote the effective and consistent implementation of the Key Attributes.\"\n",

      "        \"The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) today issued updated guidance to banks and securities firms on public disclosures in the trading and derivatives areas. The document identifies categories of information which, if publicly disclosed, will greatly assist markets and counterparties in undertaking sound risk assessment of financial institutions' trading and derivatives activities.This initiative forms part of a continued effort by the two Committees to encourage banks and securities firms to provide market participants and the general public with meaningful information on their trading and derivatives activities. The two Committees firmly believe that improved disclosures by financial institutions has a strong potential to reinforce supervisors' own efforts to foster a safe, sound and effectively supervised financial system by creating market-based incentives which reward institutions that manage their activities efficiently and in line with stated business objectives.The paper released today has benefited from comments made by financial analysts and industry practitioners throughout the world. These were generally favourable to the principle of greater disclosure. The two Committees recognise and endorse comments made by industry practitioners to the effect that the value of disclosure depends on achieving the appropriate level of materiality and that legal and proprietary considerations will be important limitations on the amount of information which it is practicable to disclose.The paper was prepared jointly by the Basel Committee's Transparency Group, chaired by Ms Susan Krause of the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the IOSCO Technical Committee Working Group on the Regulation of Financial Intermediaries, chaired by Mr Paul Wright of the UK Financial Services Authority.\"\n",

      "        \"This report sets out the FSB\\u2019s conclusions on the governance arrangements and an implementation plan for the UTI, a key globally harmonised identifier for reporting over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives transactions, in particular designed to facilitate effective aggregation of transaction reports. The final arrangements take account of stakeholder responses to a public consultation launched in March 2017, as well as an industry workshop. G20 Leaders agreed at the Pittsburgh Summit in 2009, as part of a package of reforms to the OTC derivatives markets, that all OTC derivatives transactions should be reported to trade repositories (TRs).1 A lack of transparency in these markets was one of the key problems identified by the financial crisis. Trade reporting, by providing authorities with data on trading activity in OTC derivatives markets, helps them to identify and address financial stability risks. To use the data from trade reporting effectively, it is important for authorities not only to be able to consider institution-specific risks but to be able to aggregate reporting to consider system-wide risks. The primary purpose of the UTI is to uniquely identify individual OTC derivatives transactions in reports to TRs. In particular, a UTI will help to ensure the consistent aggregation of OTC derivatives transactions by minimising the likelihood that the same transaction will be counted more than once (for instance, because it is reported by more than one counterparty to a transaction, or to more than one TR). The FSB\\u2019s conclusions and implementation plan for UTI governance arrangements complement the work of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) as they develop global guidance on harmonisation of data elements that are reported to TRs. On 28 February 2017 CPMI and IOSCO issued\\u00a0Technical Guidance: Harmonisation of the Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI Technical Guidance), setting out the UTI Data Standard, which contains a structural definition and a format specification. The UTI Technical Guidance also addresses associated matters such as the circumstances in which a UTI should be used, who should be responsible for generating a UTI, and the impact of lifecycle events on the UTI. The FSB report sets out conclusions on the governance arrangements for UTI including:   a recommendation that jurisdictions implement the UTI no later than end-2020;   the designation of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as the responsible body for publishing and maintaining the UTI data standard; and   the designation of CPMI and IOSCO as the appropriate bodies to undertake the governance functions allocated to an International Governance Body relating to the UTI on an interim basis.   The FSB believes there may be benefits to having a common governance framework, consisting of one or more international bodies, for the UTI and unique product identifier (UPI). Therefore, the FSB considers that the final identification of the International Governance Body should take place contemporaneously with the FSB making its conclusions on of the UPI Governance Arrangements. In that regard, the FSB recently consulted on governance arrangements for the UPI and published the consultation responses. In 2018, the FSB will engage in further dialogue with the industry and other stakeholders ahead of reaching its final conclusions on the UPI Governance Arrangements, including through a second public consultation.The five reforms are: trade reporting of OTC derivatives; central clearing of standardised OTC derivatives; exchange or electronic platform trading, where appropriate, of standardised OTC derivatives; higher capital requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives; and initial and variation margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives.

      "        \"Note: This document has been superseded by Sound credit risk assessment and valuation for loans, June 2006.Executive summaryThis document provides guidance to banks and banking supervisors on recognition and measurement of loans, establishment of loan loss allowances, credit risk disclosure and related matters. It sets out banking supervisors' views on sound loan accounting and disclosure practices for banks. The document also serves as a basic framework for supervisory evaluation of banks' policies and practices in these areas. It may also be helpful to accounting standard-setters.Various international bodies, including the Basel Committee, have called for progress in accounting and disclosure practices for banks' lending business and related credit risk. Accounting treatments generally, and loan accounting treatments specifically, can significantly affect the accuracy of financial and supervisory reporting and related capital calculations. Moreover, sound accounting and disclosure practices are essential to ensure the enhanced transparency needed to facilitate the effective supervision and market discipline of financial institutions. In addition to the Basel Committee, the G7 Finance Ministers, G10 central bank Governors and international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have called for progress in this area.The paper begins by stating the overall objectives of the Basel Committee in addressing the topic of sound practices for loan accounting and disclosure. It summarises key terms and ties this guidance to the credit risk management process. The paper then provides guidance on sound practices with respect to key loan accounting issues, such as the initial recognition and measurement of loans, subsequent measurement of impaired loans, the establishment of loan loss allowances, and income recognition. Moreover, the paper presents sound disclosure practices focusing on the credit risk in the loan portfolio. The paper also includes a brief discussion of the role of supervisors in assessing a bank's management of asset quality and the adequacy of loan loss allowances.Four primary concerns of supervisors regarding loan accounting and disclosure are a) the adequacy of an institution's process for determining allowances, b) the adequacy of the total allowance, c) the timely recognition of identified losses through either specific allowances or charge-offs and d) timely and accurate credit risk disclosures.The publication of this paper is a component of the Committee's long-standing work to promote effective banking supervision and safe and sound banking systems. It complements the Basel Core Principles in the field of accounting and disclosure for banks' lending business and related credit risk. International implementation of the guidelines in this paper should help achieve enhanced bank accounting policies and practices, which are consistent with sound risk management practices, in both G10 and non-G10 countries, as well as increased convergence of such policies and practices across banks and countries.\"\n",

      "        \"Executive SummaryPurpose of this Report In its recent Consultative Paper on a New Capital Adequacy Framework, the Basel Committee stated that development of an internal-ratings based approach (\\\"IRB approach\\\") to regulatory capital would be a key element in the multi-track effort to revise the Accord. In particular, the Committee noted that a capital regime based on internal ratings can prove to be more sensitive to the level of risk in a bank's portfolio, and can provide incentives for industry-wide improvements in risk management practices, consistent with the objectives set forward for the reform of the Accord. The Committee also noted that internal ratings may incorporate supplementary customer information which is usually out of the reach of an external credit assessment institutions; thus, in offering a parallel alternative to the standardised approach based on internal ratings, the Committee hopes that banks will further refine internal credit risk management and measurement techniques.In spring 1999, the Committee's Models Task Force received a mandate to embark on a study of banks' internal rating systems and processes, and to evaluate the options for relating internal ratings to a regulatory scheme. (An internal rating refers to a summary indicator of the risk inherent in an individual credit. Ratings typically embody an assessment of the risk of loss due to failure by a given borrower to pay as promised, based on consideration of relevant counterparty and facility characteristics. A rating system includes the conceptual methodology, management processes, and systems that play a role in the assignment of a rating.) The Models Task Force is currently working towards this effort, consistent with the objectives noted above, by developing an evolutionary structure that moves rapidly toward basing credit risk capital requirements on a bank's internal ratings to the extent that current bank and supervisory practice will allow. The approach further allows for greater risk sensitivity across banks and over time through a series of incremental improvements - to be developed now or in the future - designed to reflect enhancements in banks' risk management practices. This report presents the preliminary findings of the Models Task Force's recent efforts in developing this evolutionary approach - an assessment of the current state of practice in rating systems and processes, and (of equal importance) the range of practices across institutions.Since receiving its mandate, the Models Task Force has been actively engaged in gathering information about banks' internal rating systems, and assessing both the \\\"best practice\\\" and overall sound practice in this area. As part of its information gathering, in the spring the Models Task Force undertook a survey of around thirty institutions across the G-10, identified by respective national supervisors as having well-developed internal rating systems. The findings of this survey were supplemented by a series of in-depth presentations from banks and other industry practitioners in September and October, and continuing work by individual Models Task Force members.These findings will clearly guide the Models Task Force's thinking on its further work regarding how an IRB approach to capital requirements might be structured, and the accompanying sound practice standards and guidelines banks will be expected to follow in order to qualify for the IRB approach. In addition, the Committee believes that these findings have an important bearing on sound practice in credit risk management and on the desirable course of evolution in this field.The Committee has therefore decided to publish this document at this stage to seek the industry's comments on whether the range of practice identified in the report is truly representative of behaviour, across both banks and countries. In particular, the Committee would welcome feedback on:the extent to which the range of practice identified represents \\\"best\\\" or \\\"sound\\\" practice,whether important elements of a bank's rating process have been omitted or are given insufficient attention, andwhether the Models Task Force's preliminary conclusions in respect of some of the elements - for example, the data constraints encountered by many banks in quantifying loss-given-default - are fair and reasonable.Comments on the report should be sent to the Basel Committee Secretariat, Bank for International Settlements, Basel, Switzerland, CH 4002, by 31 March 2000.  \"\n",

The present document serves as a point of reference for the determination of SRB decisions on MREL for these banks. \\u00a0For the most complex banks, all of them having resolution colleges, MREL setting will be based on an enhanced MREL policy to be published later this year.\"\n",

      "        \"PrefaceIn January 1999, the Basel Committee issued a report on Banks' Interactions with Highly Leveraged Institutions (HLIs) which analysed the quality of banks' risk management practices with regard to HLIs and discussed the related supervisory and regulatory issues. With respect to the latter, the report described different approaches which included indirect supervisory approaches, enhanced transparency and various direct approaches. While the broader policy issues are currently being addressed by various international groupings, the Committee, through its Working Group on Highly Leveraged Institutions, has focused on monitoring the implementation of the Sound Practices paper which it issued in conjunction with its analytical report.The various sound practices recommended by the Committee were prompted by the experience of weaknesses in banks' risk management practices with respect to HLIs such as hedge funds, as witnessed, in particular, during the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management. A year after the publication of its original analysis and recommendations the Committee is providing an assessment of the response to its recommendations. This is important because HLIs can be expected to continue to expand their activities and to remain important players in the financial markets.This anniversary review is based on the results of an informal survey carried out by banking supervisors in the G10 countries during 1999. The supervisors aimed to establish how banks in their jurisdiction have taken steps to improve the management of their involvement with HLIs. The survey recorded only a snapshot of the response by banks to the Committee's recommendations and as a result this follow-up report should be seen as a preliminary assessment of the progress made so far. This review also incorporates the Committee's assessment of the responses which have been formulated by various industry groups to the Committee's analysis and recommendations. These responses accepted and confirmed, by and large, the Committee's findings and proposals.Over the period covered by the survey, banks appear to have considerably reduced their exposures to HLIs, although it should be pointed out that the number of banks having sizeable involvement with such institutions varies significantly from country to country. The decline in exposures may reflect a direct response to the increased uncertainty in the aftermath of the LTCM-incident. However, it is also important to evaluate banks' behaviour in the longer run, through improvements in their risk management practices vis-\\u00e0-vis HLIs.Overall, the Committee recognises that progress has been made in this field since the release of its report in early 1999. The Committee notes the steps that have been taken by bank supervisors and individual banks in addressing the concerns that were identified in its report and in implementing its proposed sound practices. Varying degrees of progress have been made with respect to banks' awareness of the potential risks and weaknesses in dealing with HLIs, due diligence in their credit policies for such institutions, collateral management arrangements when dealing with HLIs, and risk measurement practices. These improvements by banks play a critical role in the reduction of the potential risks posed to the financial system by the activities of HLIs.Whereas a general consensus has emerged regarding the need for banks to improve the management of their counterparty credit exposures vis-\\u00e0-vis HLIs, the development and implementation of enhanced risk measurement and management techniques has proven to be more difficult in some cases. This report therefore identifies a number of areas that require sustained attention.Whatever the level of banks' direct exposures to HLIs, as pointed out in the Committee's report on HLIs, all banks and other market participants are likely to be affected by the second or third order effects that may result from a default of a large HLI. In addition, many of the issues identified in the Committee's report extend beyond the HLI sector and apply to the risk management of trading counterparties more generally. While the report focuses on progress with respect to HLI counterparties, its content should be seen in the light of possible future problems with all kinds of counterparties. The findings and follow-up recommendations of this report should therefore be of interest to a wide number of countries and organisations. \"\n",

The vast majority of countries have endorsed the Core Principles and have declared their intention to implement them. As a first step to full implementation, an assessment of the current situation of a country's compliance with the Principles should take place. To assist the assessment process, the Basel Committee has developed a methodology for use in compliance assessments. This document The Core Principles Methodology is now being publicly released. The Committee sees the formulation of this document as an iterative process, with refinements made as experience is gained. Developments of regulatory and supervisory standards and procedures will lead to additions and revisions. Thus, this document will be updated periodically.\"\n",

The TLAC standard is designed so that if a G-SIB fails it has sufficient loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity available to implement an orderly resolution that minimises impacts on financial stability, ensures the continuity of critical functions and avoids exposing public funds to loss. The TLAC standard defines a minimum requirement for the instruments and liabilities that should be held by G-SIBs and readily available for bail-in within resolution. It also requires a certain amount of those loss-absorbing resources to be committed to subsidiaries or sub-groups that are located in host jurisdictions and deemed material for the resolution of the G-SIB as a whole (\\u2018internal TLAC\\u2019). The guiding principles support the implementation of the internal TLAC requirement and provide guidance on the size and composition of the internal TLAC requirement, cooperation and coordination between home and host authorities and the trigger mechanism for internal TLAC. The guiding principles were issued for public consultation in December 2016 and have been revised in light of the comments received during that consultation.\"\n",

      "        \"This report finalises the measure and metrics of non-cash collateral re-use in securities financing transactions that authorities will monitor for financial stability purposes. The re-use of collateral plays an important role in the functioning of financial markets. It increases the availability\\u00a0of collateral, reduces the cost of using it, and consequently reduces transaction and liquidity costs. At the same time, however, as highlighted during the 2007-09 global financial crisis, collateral re-use may pose potential risks to the financial system. For example, collateral re-use may contribute to a build-up of excessive leverage of individual entities and in the financial system as a whole. It may also increase interconnectedness among market participants, through chains of transactions involving the re-use of collateral, which may create a risk of contagion where fails to deliver re-used collateral by one party may potentially cause additional fails. The FSB published a public consultation\\u00a0on possible measures for assessing collateral re-use in February 2016. In light of the responses received, the FSB has now finalised the measure and metrics of non-cash collateral re-use as well as the related data elements to monitor collateral re-use which is restricted to collateral received and subsequently re-used in securities financing transactions. FSB members have agreed to transmit the national aggregated data to the FSB for global aggregation so as to assess global trends in non-cash collateral re-use. An aggregate measure of collateral re-use, available at both a national and global level, will provide insights into the contribution of interconnectedness in the collateral markets and the build-up of leverage. The FSB also highlights the need to review the scope, measure and metrics of collateral re-use as market practices evolve. This is planned to be undertaken five years after the launch of the global data collection with regard to non-cash collateral re-use, with a continued discussion with market participants as appropriate. This report is part of the FSB\\u2019s work to transform shadow banking into resilient market-based finance, in particular its work to improve reporting and transparency of securities financing markets. The FSB has developed, in cooperation with market participants, standards and processes for global securities financing data collection and aggregation that are relevant for financial stability monitoring and policy responses. Such standards and processes will allow the FSB to collect from national/regional authorities aggregated data on repos, securities lending and margin lending, based on consistent definitions and minimal double counting at the global level. The finalised standards\\u00a0were\\u00a0published\\u00a0in November 2015 and the FSB has started work on the detailed operational arrangements to initiate the official data collection and aggregation at the end of 2018. Data related to collateral re-use will be transmitted to the FSB for global aggregation from January 2020.\"\n",

The Recommendations are directed to the relevant national supervisory authorities for firms in all financial sectors. They build on national supervisory work and existing international efforts including Basel Committee Pillar III disclosures on compensation. They will help supervisors understand whether governance and risk management processes at financial institutions:   Appropriately include conduct considerations in the design of their compensation and incentive systems, including the setting of individual goals, ex ante performance measurement mechanisms and ex post compensation adjustments;   Support the effective use of compensation tools in combination with other performance management tools to help promote good conduct or to remediate misconduct;   Promote wider risk management goals, including for conduct issues, consistent with the firm\\u2019s strategy and risk tolerance; and   Support the effective identification of emerging misconduct risks and appropriate review of incentive systems and compensation decisions in response to conduct incidents to ensure alignment of incentives, risk and reward.   In recent years, supervisors and firms have directed significant attention to improving compensation governance and risk adjustment practices. They have focused more intensively on the impact compensation and related performance management mechanisms can have on incentives, and the role they can play in addressing misconduct risks, by providing both ex ante incentives for good conduct and ex post adjustment mechanisms that support appropriate accountability when misconduct occurs. The FSB\\u2019s 2015 Workplan on Measures to Reduce Misconduct Risk\\u00a0 promoted incentives for good behaviour through:   Standards and codes of behaviour, such as the FX Global Code, and reforms to benchmark-setting practices;   A toolkit of measures to address misconduct in wholesale markets developed by the International Organization of Securities Commissions, based on national approaches;   FSB guidance on the use of compensation tools to promote good conduct; and   A toolkit to strengthen governance frameworks to mitigate misconduct risk.   The most recent update on progress\\u00a0under the overall Workplan on Measures to Reduce Misconduct Risk was delivered to the Hamburg G20 Summit in July 2017.\"\n",

It may also provide efficient credit in the economy as some non-bank entities may have specialised expertise that enables them to provide certain functions in the credit intermediation chain more cost-efficiently.

Bail-in within resolution is at the core of resolution strategies for G-SIBs. It helps achieve a creditor-financed recapitalisation by way of a write-down and conversion of liabilities into equity that minimises impacts on financial stability, ensures the continuity of critical functions, and avoids exposing taxpayers to loss. The guidance sets out principles to assist authorities as they make bail-in resolution strategies operational. The principles cover:   disclosures on the instruments and liabilities within the scope of bail-in;   valuations to inform and support the application of bail-in;   processes to suspend or cancel the listing of securities, to notify creditors, and to deliver new securities or tradeable certificates following entry into resolution;   securities law and securities exchange requirements during the bail-in;   processes for transferring governance and control rights to a new board and management for the firm emerging from resolution; and   communications to creditors and the market at large.   The FSB consulted on the guidance in November 2017 and this final version of the guidance incorporates changes to reflect public feedback.\"\n",

      "        \"This paper outlines a set of sound practices for managing liquidity in banking organisations. This paper forms part of an ongoing effort by the Committee to strengthen procedures for risk management in banks. The Committee believes that liquidity - the ability to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they become due - is crucial to the ongoing viability of any banking organisation. But the importance of liquidity transcends the individual bank since a liquidity shortfall at a single organisation can have systemic repercussions. The management of liquidity is therefore among the most important activities conducted at banks.Over time, there has been a declining ability to rely on core deposits and an increased reliance on wholesale funding. Recent technological and financial innovations have provided banks with new ways of funding their activities and managing their liquidity, but recent turmoil in global financial markets has posed new challenges for liquidity management. In light of these developments, the Committee is replacing the existing 1992 paper on liquidity - A framework for measuring and managing liquidity - with updated guidance. The paper is organised around a set of 14 principles falling in the following key areas:Developing a structure for managing liquidityMeasuring and monitoring net funding requirementsManaging market accessContingency planningForeign currency liquidity managementInternal controls for liquidity risk managementRole of public disclosure in improving liquidityRole of supervisorsThe paper is not being issued formally for consultation, but if you have strong views our Risk Management Group would be pleased to receive them. \"\n",

It is designed to support and strengthen the third pillar of the consultative paper A New Capital Adequacy Framework issued by the Basel Committee in June 1999.The issuance of this paper is a component of the Basel Committee's ongoing effort to promote enhanced transparency and effective market discipline worldwide. It is a key part of the Committee's attempt to enhance capital disclosures and seeks to elaborate on disclosures that should be made in order to advance the role of market discipline in promoting bank capital adequacy.The recommendations in this paper fall into three areas: structure of capital, risk exposures and capital adequacy. The Basel Committee is firmly committed to improving public disclosure and market discipline, and invites comments on this paper on same timeframe as the consultation on A New Capital Adequacy Framework (i.e. by 31 March 2000).As discussed in the consultative paper A New Capital Adequacy Framework, the focus of the new Framework and, consequently, of the third pillar will be on internationally active banks. However, the Framework's guiding principles, as embodied in the three pillars, are generally suitable for any bank in any jurisdiction, although full account should be taken of individual circumstances.The Basel Committee recognises that the recommendations contained in this paper may need to be expanded on as debate on the consultative paper A New Capital Adequacy Framework develops and the actual new Framework itself is finalised. \"\n",

      "        \"This report delivered to the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors for their meeting in Buenos Aires from 21-22 July, describes the work of the FSB and standard-setting bodies on crypto-assets. The FSB has developed a framework, in collaboration with Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), to monitor the financial stability implications of the developments in crypto-asset markets. The report sets out the metrics that the FSB will use to monitor developments in crypto-asset markets as part of the FSB\\u2019s ongoing assessment of vulnerabilities in the financial system. While the FSB believes that crypto-assets do not pose a material risk to global financial stability at this time it recognises the need for vigilant monitoring in light of the speed of market developments. The framework focuses on the transmission channels from crypto-asset markets. Monitoring the size and growth of crypto-asset markets is critical to understanding the potential size of wealth effects, should valuations fall. The use of leverage, and financial institution exposures to crypto-asset markets are important metrics of transmission of crypto-asset risks to the broader financial system. The framework also includes metrics on trading volumes, pricing, clearing and margining for crypto-asset derivatives. Metrics on exposures will become part of the framework to the extent that they become available. FSB Chair Mark Carney in his letter to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in March noted that crypto-assets raise a host of issues around consumer and investor protection, as well as their use to shield illicit activity and for money laundering and terrorist financing. At the same time, the technologies underlying them have the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of both the financial system and the economy. Against this backdrop, the report also describes the work standard-setting bodies are undertaking in the areas of their respective mandates:   CPMI has conducted significant work on applications of distributed ledger technology, and is conducting outreach, monitoring, and analysis of payment innovations.   The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) has established an initial coin offering (ICO) Consultation Network to discuss experiences and concerns regarding ICOs, and is developing a Support Framework to assist members in considering how to address domestic and cross-border issues stemming from ICOs that could impact investor protection. IOSCO is also discussing other issues around crypto-assets, including, for example, regulatory issues around crypto-assets platforms.   The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) is assessing the materiality of banks\\u2019 direct and indirect exposures to crypto-assets, clarifying the prudential treatment of such exposures, and monitoring developments related to crypto-assets for banks and supervisors.   The Financial Action Task Force will report separately to the G20 on its work concerning the money laundering and terrorist financing risks relating to crypto-assets.\"\n",

      "        \"IntroductionThe Joint Forum on Financial Conglomerates (Joint Forum) was established in early 1996 under the aegis of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (Basle Committee), the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) to take forward the work of the Tripartite Group whose report was released in July 1995. The Joint Forum is comprised of an equal number of senior bank, insurance and securities supervisors representing each supervisory constituency. Thirteen countries are represented in the Joint Forum: Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States. The EU Commission is attending in an observer capacity.In accordance with its mandate which was agreed by the Basle Committee, IOSCO and the IAIS (collectively \\\"the parent organisations\\\"), the Joint Forum has reviewed various means to facilitate the exchange of information between supervisors within their own sectors and between supervisors in different sectors and has investigated legal or other barriers which could impede the exchange of information between supervisors within their own sectors and between supervisors in different sectors. Also, based on its mandate, the Joint Forum has examined ways to enhance supervisory coordination, including the benefits and drawbacks to establishing criteria to identify and define the responsibilities of a coordinator, and is working on developing principles toward the more effective supervision of regulated firms within financial conglomerates.The Joint Forum prepared a number of papers dealing with these matters which were released by the Basle Committee, IOSCO and the IAIS for consultation with industry and the supervisory community on a global basis from mid-February 1998 to 31 July 1998.About 60 written submissions were received on the papers. These came from a mix of governmental and supervisory agencies, industry and other interested parties worldwide. The views of industry were largely provided through their associations and in some cases through supervisory agencies.The submissions received were supportive of the work of the Joint Forum. Numerous suggestions for modifying, refining or otherwise clarifying the papers were made.In addition to the global consultation process, the Joint Forum conducted practical testing exercises on its work on capital adequacy and considered further the practical issues involved in the identification of coordinators. The Joint Forum finalised the papers in light of the comments received during the consultation process and the results of its additional work. The Basle Committee and the Technical Committees of IOSCO and the IAIS have endorsed the papers and are now prepared to release these with a recommendation to members of the parent organisations to implement the principles therein. The Basle Committee and the Technical Committees of IOSCO and the IAIS also commend the regulatory tools, techniques and other guidance set out in the papers to those members.The Basle Committee and the Technical Committees of IOSCO and the IAIS have noted concerns expressed in a number of comments from industry to the effect that the adoption of new international standards would result in an increase in the regulatory burden. The Committees would like to avoid this to the greatest extent practical and encourage supervisors, in applying the principles and other guidance in the papers to avoid any unnecessary duplication including wherever possible by acting in coordination with other supervisors.It is noted that the Joint Forum's focus has been, primarily, on diversified financial firms with complex organisational and management structures whose large scale activities cross national borders and sectoral boundaries. However, the lessons drawn and the guidance prepared could also apply to smaller conglomerates or conglomerates that only operate domestically.The papers are as follows:A. Capital Adequacy PrinciplesB. Supplement to theC. Fit and Proper PrinciplesD. Framework for Supervisory Information SharingE. Principles for Supervisory Information SharingF. Coordinator paperG. Supervisory Questionnaire.The Capital Adequacy Principles paper outlines measurement techniques and principles to facilitate the assessment of capital adequacy on a group-wide basis for financial conglomerates. This paper was significantly refined as a result of the consultation process and testing of the principles. The more significant changes include:emphasising that the suggested measurement techniques do not replace existing sectoral rules for the assessment of capital adequacy but are used to complement existing approachesaddressing the treatment of unregulated non-financial entitiesdealing with the combining and tailoring of the measurement techniquesmaking it clear that the choice of measurement technique is left at the supervisors' discretion.The Supplement to the Capital Adequacy Principles paper illustrates situations that can be faced by supervisors in practical applications of the measurement techniques.The Fit and Proper Principles paper provides guidance to ensure that supervisors of entities within a financial conglomerate are able to exercise their responsibilities to assess whether those entities are soundly and prudently managed.The Framework for Supervisory Information Sharing paper sets out a general framework for facilitating information-sharing between supervisors of regulated entities within internationally active financial conglomerates.The Principles for Supervisory Information Sharing paper provides to supervisors involved in the oversight of regulated financial institutions residing in financial conglomerates guiding principles with respect to supervisory information sharing. The Ten Key Principles on Information Sharing issued by the G-7 Finance Ministers in May 1998 which complement the principles developed by the Joint Forum, are annexed to this paper.The Coordinator paper provides to supervisors guidance for the possible identification of a coordinator or coordinators and a catalogue of elements of coordination from which supervisors can select the role and responsibilities of a coordinator or coordinators in emergency and non-emergency situations. In May 1998, the G-7 Finance Ministers endorsed the principles in this paper and urged the supervisory bodies to take quickly the decisions on the implementation of these proposals, as some national supervisors move towards establishing coordinators for their major groups. Many of the submissions received from industry and the supervisory community suggested modifying the principles in various ways generally with a view to enhancing effective coordination. After examining actual experiences in supervisory coordination, the Forum concluded that it would be preferable to proceed to implementation of the principles rather than to attempt further refinement at this stage.The Supervisory Questionnaire is a tool to assist supervisors in better understanding each others' objectives and approaches. It is expected that experience gained in using the Questionnaire, will result in changes to enhance its coverage and make it a more useful tool to better understand supervisors' objectives and approaches.PDF:Full document (143 pages, 444176 bytes)Table of Contents and Introduction (6 pages, 20377 bytes)Capital Adequacy Principles paper (23 pages, 92885 bytes)Supplement to the Capital Adequacy Principles paper (12 pages, 37889 bytes)Fit and Proper Principles paper (6 pages, 17713 bytes)Framework for Supervisory Information Sharing paper (17 pages, 55007 bytes)Annex A: Conglomerate Questionnaire (19 pages, 54698 bytes)Conglomerate Matrix (13 pages, 48189 bytes)Annex B: Outline of Types of Information that would be Useful in an Emergency Situation (7 pages, 25746 bytes)Principles for Supervisory Information Sharing paper (9 pages, 26362 bytes)G-7 Ten Key Principles on Information Sharing (3 pages, 16248 bytes)Coordinator paper (9 pages, 28799 bytes)Supervisory Questionnaire (6 pages, 15397 bytes)\"\n",

In so doing, authorities will be mindful of the impact interventions may have on the public purse and will, as far as possible:  maintain incentives for financial institutions to behave prudently,\\uf0b7 promote private sector solutions and use public sector interventions only when this is necessary to preserve financial stability, and maintain a level competitive international playing field, in the spirit of the Basel Accord.     While financial crisis management remains a domestic competence, the growing interactions between national financial systems require international cooperation by authorities. Home authorities should lead work with the key host authorities to look at the practical barriers to achieving coordinated action in the event of a financial crisis involving specific firms, for every cross-border bank identified by the FSF as having or going to have a core supervisory college. Some of these barriers will be common to more than one firm, and these principles suggest common support tools. Home authorities of other important banks and other financial firms that have systemic implications in several countries may also wish to coordinate the development of crisis management arrangements around those firms.

In order to assess the adequacy of capital charges based on the internal models approach, the Models Task Force conducted a survey analysing over 40 banks, located in 9 countries, that were subject to the requirements set forward in the Amendment. The survey covers the third and fourth quarters of 1998, a period of high market volatility. The evidence gathered is anecdotal in nature and is based on a fairly short time period; consequently the survey does not permit strong conclusions to be drawn concerning the robustness of the models. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the capital charge under the internal models approach provided an adequate buffer against trading loss at these institutions during this period. Looking forward, the Models Task Force believes that banks that use the internal models approach should continue to reassess the performance of these models, and continue to complement them by a robust stress-testing program, in line with the requirements of the Amendment.\"\n",

Based on the findings of the review, six recommendations were set out, one of which asked the FSB to develop an international principles-based framework for sound underwriting practices. After providing sufficient time for implementation, the FSB will conduct a follow-up review to assess progress made in implementing the framework. Given that the underlying risks can differ across jurisdictions, the Principles are high-level rather than aimed at detailed international standards. As the global crisis demonstrated, the consequences of weak residential mortgage underwriting practices in one country can be transferred globally through securitisation of mortgages underwritten to weak standards. As such, it is important to have sound underwriting practices at the point at which a mortgage loan is originally made.\\u00a0 To help inform the final internationally agreed principles, the FSB welcomes comments on the consultative document. Responses should be sent to [email\\u00a0protected] by Friday 9 December 2011. The final set of principles will be released in early 2012.\"\n",

The paper does not represent a prediction of the likelihood of occurrence, but rather attempts to provide a range of possible precautions that should be considered in preparing for the Year 2000. It is being distributed as part of a package of papers issued by the Joint Year 2000 Council which represents supervisors across the financial sector.The paper has been drawn up for the reference of bank supervisors, and it is not directed at contingency planning by banks. This matter is addressed in another document being released by the Joint Council entitled \\\"Year 2000 Business Continuity Planning: Guidance for Financial Institutions\\\".\"\n",

The principles aim to catalyse a significant change in existing practices, to end mechanistic reliance by market participants and establish stronger internal credit risk assessment practices instead. They set out broad objectives, for standard setters and regulators to follow up by defining the more specific actions that will be needed to implement the changes over time. Continue reading\"\n",

      "        \"Executive summaryThe publication of this fifth annual survey report on the trading and derivatives disclosures of major G10 banks and securities firms represents a continued effort by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the IOSCO Technical Committee to encourage financial institutions to enhance the transparency of their trading and derivatives activities. Transparency through public disclosure is crucial to effective market discipline and can reinforce supervisory efforts to promote high standards in risk management. The two committees consider the transparency of banks' and securities firms' activities and risks to be a key element of an effectively supervised financial system.This survey examines the public disclosures of trading and derivatives activities of 71 of the world's leading banks and securities firms headquartered in the G10 countries. At the close of the financial year, they represented a total asset base of over USD 17 trillion and a total notional amount of derivatives of more than USD 130 trillion. The average institution had a notional amount of derivatives equal to more than seven times its total assets.The survey reveals that virtually all surveyed banks and securities firms disclosed information on market risk and their methods of managing this risk in their 1998 financial reports. Examples of common market risk information included model parameters (e.g. holding period, confidence level and method of aggregating risk factors) and value-at-risk numbers generated by the models. While financial institutions generally provided information on credit risk management policies and credit risk exposures, information on credit risk measurement models was much less common. The majority of banks and securities firms also disclosed information on the management of liquidity risk and operational risk.An important objective of this year's survey effort was to determine the extent to which banks and securities firms meet the updated recommendations for public disclosure of trading and derivative activities issued by the two committees in October 1999. The survey instrument has therefore been substantially updated and revised to reflect this new disclosure guidance. A comparison with previous surveys nevertheless reveals that many leading institutions continued to expand their disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information about market risk and market risk models in their 1998 financial reports.While financial institutions did not have an opportunity to consider the updated guidance when they designed the disclosures surveyed in this report, institutions that do not already provide the recommended disclosures are strongly encouraged to improve their future disclosures in line with that guidance. In addition, banks and securities firms should consider the types of disclosures provided by their peers at the international level as indicated in this survey report. \"\n",

This call was endorsed by the IMF's International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC). Data gaps are an inevitable consequence of the ongoing development of markets and institutions. As has been true of previous international financial crises, these gaps are highlighted when a lack of timely, accurate information hinders the ability of policy makers and market participants to develop effective responses.

Those fault lines centred on a heavy reliance on short-term wholesale funding, a variety of incentives problems in securitisation that weakened lending standards, and a general lack of transparency that hid growing amounts of leverage and mismatch between long-term credit extension and short-term funding. The FSB's strategy to deal with these fault lines has two elements:  Create a monitoring framework to track financial sector developments outside the banking system. The FSB has established an annual monitoring exercise to assess the global trends and risks of the shadow banking system, which now includes jurisdictions covering 90% of global financial system assets. The third global shadow banking monitoring report will be published in November 2013. Develop policies to strengthen oversight and regulation of the shadow banking system.\"\n",

High short-term profits led to generous bonus payments to employees without adequate regard to the longer-term risks they imposed on their firms. These perverse incentives amplified the excessive risk-taking that severely threatened the global financial system and left firms with fewer resources to absorb losses as risks materialised. The Principles intend to apply to significant financial institutions but are especially critical for large, systemically important firms. They will be implemented by firms and will be reinforced through supervisory examination and intervention at the national level. Authorities, working through the FSF, will ensure coordination and consistency of approaches across jurisdictions. The Principles are intended to reduce incentives towards excessive risk taking that may arise from the structure of compensation schemes. They are not intended to prescribe particular designs or levels of individual compensation.\"\n",

In November 2012, the FSB published its consultative document A Policy Framework for Addressing Shadow Banking Risks in Securities Lending and Repos\\u00a0which identified the financial stability issues (or shadow banking risks) in securities lending and repo markets, and set out 13 policy recommendations to address such risks. These included: improvements in regulatory reporting and market transparency; regulation of securities financing (e.g. minimum standards for methodologies used by market participants in calculating the \\\"haircuts\\\" (margins) that limit the amount of financing that can be provided against a given security and minimum standards on cash collateral reinvestment), as well as policy recommendations related to structural aspects of the securities financing markets such as central clearing. The FSB also invited views on the possible introduction of a framework of numerical haircut floors for certain securities financing transactions which are intended to limit the extent to which financial entities, including non-banks, can use securities financing transactions to obtain leverage. These measures, if appropriately implemented, would help counteract pro-cyclical fluctuations in securities financing. Consultation responses were received from more than 50 respondents including trade associations representing both securities borrowers and lenders, intermediaries in the securities lending and repo markets, asset managers, market infrastructure providers and public authorities. In general, the respondents agreed with the analysis of FSB but cautioned against possible negative impacts and unintended consequences on repo and securities lending markets that function as the core funding market for financial institutions and promote price discovery for other related markets.\"\n",

It\\u00a0sets out recommendations for improving the authorities' ability to resolve such institutions in an orderly manner, without exposing tax-payers to loss, while maintaining continuity of their vital economic functions. This will require changes to resolution regimes and tools at national levels, and legislative changes to enable resolution authorities to co-ordinate in cross-border resolutions. The report recommends that in particular financial institutions that are clearly systemic in a global context (G-SIFIs) should have higher loss-absorbency capacity than the minimum levels agreed in Basel III. These institutions must also be subject to more intensive coordinated supervision and resolution planning to reduce the probability and impact of their failure.\"\n",

This paper brings together practice and \\ntechniques currently employed by major international banks in a single analytical framework. \\nWhile no bank may follow this framework precisely, it is a model which is believed to be an \\nexample of current sound management practice and which could provide useful guidance to \\nall banks. \\n The seventh ICBS provides an opportunity for other supervisory authorities to \\ncontribute to this work and it is the Committee\\'s intention to prepare a revised version of this \\npaper taking account of comments made at Cannes which could then be circulated to \\nsupervisory authorities worldwide with the possibility of it being made available through \\nthem to commercial banks.  \\n \\n I. Purpose of the analysis \\n \\n  Measuring and managing liquidity are among the most vital activities of \\ncommercial banks. By assuring a bank\\'s ability to meet its liabilities as they come due, \\nliquidity management can reduce the probability of an irreversible adverse situation \\ndeveloping. Even in cases where a crisis develops because of a problem elsewhere at a bank, \\nsuch as a severe deterioration in asset quality or the uncovering of fraud, or where a crisis \\nreflects a generalised loss of confidence in financial institutions, the time available to a bank \\nto address the problem will be determined by its liquidity. Indeed, the importance of liquidity \\ntranscends the individual institution, since a liquidity shortfall at a single institution can have \\nsystem-wide repercussions. For this reason, the analysis of liquidity requires bank \\nmanagements to measure not only the liquidity positions of banks on an ongoing basis but \\nalso to examine how funding requirements are likely to evolve under crisis scenarios. \\n This paper sets out in general terms the main elements of a model liquidity \\nmeasurement and management framework. The framework strikes a balance between \\nquantitative and qualitative factors used to assess liquidity, and provides a methodology for \\nanalysing balance sheet and off-balance-sheet activities consistently.   \\n While this paper focuses on the use of the framework by large banks, the \\napproach it describes appears to have broad applicability to bank liquidity measurement and \\ncontrol, even for small, strictly domestic banks. In particular, good management information \\nsystems, central liquidity control, analysis of net funding requirements under alternative \\n \\n A later document on the same topic was published in February 2000. http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs69.htm \\n  \\n \\n page   \\n - 2 - \\n \\n scenarios, diversification of funding sources, and contingency planning are crucial elements \\nof strong liquidity management at a bank of any size or scope of operations. The information \\nsystems and analysis needed to implement the approach, however, can probably absorb fewer \\nresources and be much less complex at a smaller institution or one that is active in fewer \\nmarkets than the large, internationally active banks contemplated in this paper.   \\n \\n II. Policy issues \\n \\n A. Information and reporting arrangements \\n Virtually every financial transaction or commitment has implications for a bank\\'s \\nliquidity. Moreover, the transformation of illiquid assets into more liquid ones is a key \\nactivity of banks. Thus, a bank\\'s liquidity policies and liquidity management approach should \\nform key elements of a bank\\'s general business strategy. Understanding the context of \\nliquidity management involves examining a bank\\'s managerial approach to funding and \\nliquidity operations and its liquidity planning under alternative scenarios. \\n In particular, all banks should have an articulated and specific liquidity policy \\nsetting out the general importance management places on liquidity. Such a policy should also \\nenunciate specific policies on particular aspects of liquidity management, such as the relative \\nreliance on the use of certain financial instruments and the encouragement of closer \\nrelationships with supervisors. This general policy should be approved by a bank\\'s board of \\ndirectors. \\n An important element in such a policy will be a liquidity reporting structure \\ndesigned to provide senior management with timely information and to be flexible enough to \\ndeal with various contingencies that may arise during crises. Banks that stress the importance \\nof liquidity assign ultimate responsibility for setting liquidity policy and reviewing liquidity \\ndecisions to the bank\\'s highest level of management, and their decisions need to be reviewed \\nperiodically by the board of directors. \\n A bank\\'s investment in information systems designed to gather and analyse \\ndetailed information on assets and liabilities may need to be substantial. Because market \\nconditions and a bank\\'s own liquidity needs change constantly, extensive computer systems \\nare often necessary to provide management with relevant information on an accurate and up-\\nto-date basis. Such systems can also be helpful in projecting the bank\\'s liquidity positions \\nunder a variety of conditions. Sometimes these systems are integrated into information \\nsystems monitoring other activities or risk exposures of the bank. \\n Finally, a schedule of frequent routine liquidity reviews and less frequent, but \\nmore in-depth reviews should be provided for. These reviews provide the opportunity to re-\\nexamine and refine a bank\\'s liquidity policies and practices in the light of a bank\\'s liquidity \\nexperience and developments in its business. \\n \\n A later document on the same topic was published in February 2000. http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs69.htm \\n  \\n \\n page   \\n - 3 - \\n \\n B. Treatment of foreign currencies \\n For banks with an international presence, the treatment of assets and liabilities in \\nmultiple currencies adds a layer of complexity to liquidity management for two reasons. First, \\nbanks are often less well known to liability holders in foreign currency markets. In the event \\nof market concerns, especially if they relate to a bank\\'s domestic operating environment, these \\nliability holders may not be able to distinguish rumour from fact as well or as quickly as \\ndomestic currency customers. Second, in the event of a disturbance, a bank may not always be \\nable to mobilise domestic liquidity to meet foreign currency funding requirements. \\n Hence, when a bank conducts its business in multiple currencies, its management \\nmust make two key decisions. The first concerns management structure. A bank with funding \\nrequirements in foreign currencies will generally use one of three approaches. It may \\ncompletely centralise liquidity management (the head office managing liquidity for the whole \\nbank in every currency). Alternatively, it may decentralise by assigning operating divisions \\nresponsibility for their own liquidity, but subject to limits imposed by the head office or \\nfrequent, routine reporting to the head office. For example, a non-European bank might assign \\nits London office responsibility for the liquidity management for its European operations in \\nall currencies. As a third approach, a bank may assign responsibility for liquidity in the home \\ncurrency and for overall coordination to the home office, and responsibility for the bank\\'s \\nglobal liquidity in each major foreign currency to the management of the foreign office in the \\ncountry issuing that currency. For example, the treasurer in the Tokyo office of a non-\\nJapanese bank could be responsible for the bank\\'s global liquidity needs in yen. All of these \\napproaches, however, provide head office management with the opportunity to monitor and \\ncontrol worldwide liquidity.  \\n The second decision concerns the liquidity strategy in each currency. In the \\nordinary course of business, a bank must decide how foreign currency funding needs will be \\nmet. To what extent, for example, will a bank fund foreign currency needs in domestic \\ncurrency and convert the proceeds to foreign currency through the foreign exchange market or \\ncurrency swaps? How will a bank manage the associated risk that exchange markets will \\ncease to be available? A bank\\'s assessment will depend on the size of its funding needs, its \\naccess to foreign currency funding markets, and its capacity to rely on off-balance-sheet \\ninstruments (e.g. standby lines of credit, swap facilities, etc.). \\n A bank must also develop a back-up liquidity strategy for circumstances in which \\nits normal approach to funding foreign currency operations is disrupted. Such a strategy will \\ncall for drawing either on home currency sources and converting them to foreign currency \\nthrough the exchange markets or drawing on back-up sources in particular foreign currencies. \\nFor example, back-up liquidity for all currencies may be provided by the head office using the \\nhome currency, based on an assessment of the bank\\'s access to the foreign exchange market \\nand the derivative markets under the conditions in which the original liquidity disturbance is \\nlikely to occur. Alternatively, a bank\\'s management may decide that certain foreign currencies \\n \\n A later document on the same topic was published in February 2000. http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs69.htm \\n  \\n \\n page   \\n - 4 - \\n \\n make up a sufficient part of its liquidity needs to warrant separate liquidity back-up. In that \\ncase, either the home office or the regional treasurer for each specific currency would develop \\na contingency strategy and negotiate liquidity backstop facilities for those currencies. \\n \\n III. A framework for measuring and managing liquidity \\n \\n  The framework for assessing and managing bank liquidity presented here has \\nthree major dimensions: (A) measuring and managing net funding requirements, (B) \\nmanaging market access, and (C) contingency planning. \\n \\n A. Measuring and managing net funding requirements \\n The analysis of net funding requirements involves the construction of a maturity \\nladder and the calculation of a cumulative net excess or deficit of funds at selected maturity \\ndates. A bank\\'s net funding requirements are determined by analysing its future cash flows \\nbased on assumptions of the future behaviour of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items, \\nand then calculating the cumulative net excess over the time frame for the liquidity \\nassessment. \\n \\n (i) The maturity ladder \\n A maturity ladder should be used to compare a bank\\'s future cash inflows to its \\nfuture cash outflows over a series of specified time periods. Cash inflows arise from maturing \\nassets, saleable non-maturing assets and established credit lines that can be tapped. Cash \\noutflows include liabilities falling due and contingent liabilities, especially committed lines of \\ncredit that can be drawn down. In Table 1, the maturity ladder is represented by placing \\nsources and amounts of cash inflows on one side of the page and sources and amounts of \\noutflows on the other.  \\n In constructing the maturity ladder, a bank has to allocate each cash inflow or \\noutflow to a given calendar date from a starting point, usually the next day. (A bank must be \\nclear about the clearing and settlement conventions it is using to determine its initial point.) \\nAs a preliminary step to constructing the maturity ladder, cash inflows can be ranked by the \\ndate on which assets mature or a conservative estimate of when credit lines can be drawn \\ndown. Similarly, cash outflows can be ranked by the date on which liabilities fall due, the \\nearliest date a liability holder could exercise an early repayment option, or the earliest date \\ncontingencies can be called. Significant interest and other cash flows should also be included. \\nThe difference between cash inflows and cash outflows in each period, the excess or deficit of \\nfunds, becomes a starting-point for a measure of a bank\\'s future liquidity excess or shortfall at \\na series of points in time. \\n It is this net funding requirement that requires management. Typically, a bank \\nmay find substantial funding gaps in distant periods and will endeavour to fill these gaps by \\ninfluencing the maturity of transactions so as to offset the gap. For example, if there is a \\nsignificant funding requirement 30 days hence, a bank may choose to acquire an asset \\n \\n A later document on the same topic was published in February 2000. http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs69.htm \\n  \\n \\n page   \\n - 5 - \\n \\n maturing on that day, or seek to renew or roll over a liability. The closer a large gap gets, the \\nmore difficult it is to offset. Thus, banks will typically collect data on relatively distant \\nperiods so as to maximise the opportunities to close the gap before it gets too close. Most \\nbanks would regard it as important that any remaining borrowing requirement should be \\nlimited to an amount which experience suggests is comfortably within the bank\\'s capacity to \\nfund in the market. \\n \\n (ii) Alternative scenarios \\n Evaluating whether a bank is sufficiently liquid depends in large measure on the \\nbehaviour of cash flows under different conditions. Analysing liquidity thus entails laying out \\n\"what if\" scenarios. Three scenarios provide useful benchmarks: a bank\\'s \"going-concern\" \\ncondition, a bank-specific crisis, and a general market crisis. Under each scenario, a bank \\nshould try to account for any significant positive or negative liquidity swings that could \\noccur. \\n(a) The going-concern scenario establishes a benchmark for the \"normal\" behaviour \\nof balance sheet-related cash flows in the ordinary course of business at a bank. This scenario \\nis useful in managing a bank\\'s use of deposit and other debt markets. By establishing such a \\nbenchmark, a bank can manage its net funding requirements so that it is not faced with very \\nlarge needs on any given day, so avoiding the impact of temporary constraints on its ability to \\nroll over liabilities because of market disruptions or concerns about its condition. \\n(b) Assessing liquidity under the second scenario, a liquidity crisis at an individual \\nbank that remains confined to that bank, provides one type of \"worst-case\" benchmark. The \\nkey underlying assumption in this scenario is that many of the bank\\'s liabilities could not be \\nrolled over or replaced and would have to be repaid at maturity so that the bank would have to \\nwind down its books to some degree. This is the scenario implicit in many existing bank \\nsupervisory liquidity measures. While a severe liquidity crisis at an individual bank usually \\nstems from a fundamental, bank-specific problem not related to its liquidity, a bank\\'s ability \\nto honour its deposit maturities under such conditions can provide the time that the bank \\nwould need to address the underlying problem. If a bank can weather such a \"worst-case\" \\nscenario, it can almost certainly survive less drastic firm-specific problems. \\n(c) The last scenario is some form of general market crisis where liquidity is affected \\nat all banks in one or more markets. The key underlying assumption that banks need to make \\nin this scenario is that severe tiering by perceived credit quality would occur, so that \\ndifferences in funding access among banks or among classes of financial institutions would \\nwiden, benefiting some and harming others. Although some banks may believe that central \\nbanks would ensure that key markets would continue to function in some form, severe market \\ndisruption would not necessarily be prevented. For bank management, this represents a \\nsecond type of \"worst-case\" scenario that a bank would wish to weather. A supervisor or \\ncentral bank may find this scenario to be of particular interest when surveying the liquidity \\nprofile of the entire banking sector. The collective results would suggest the size of the total \\n \\n A later document on the same topic was published in February 2000. http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs69.htm \\n  \\n \\n page   \\n - 6 - \\n \\n liquidity buffer in the banking system and the likely distribution of liquidity problems among \\nlarge institutions if the banking system as a whole experiences a shortage of liquidity. \\n A bank will need to assign the timing of cash flows for each type of asset and \\nliability by assessing the probability of the behaviour of those cash flows in the scenario \\nbeing examined. These decisions about the specific timing and the size of cash flows are an \\nintegral part of the construction of the maturity ladder under each scenario. For each funding \\nsource, for example, a bank would have to decide whether the liability would be: (1) repaid in \\nfull at maturity; (2) gradually run off over the next few weeks; or (3) virtually certain to be \\nrolled over or available if tapped. The bank\\'s historical experience of the pattern of flows and \\na knowledge of market conventions could guide a bank\\'s decisions, but judgement often plays \\na large role, especially in crisis scenarios. Uncertainty is an inevitable element in choosing \\nbetween possible behaviour patterns, and that dictates a conservative approach that would \\nbias a bank toward assigning later dates to cash inflows and earlier dates to cash outflows. \\n Hence, the timing of cash inflows and outflows on the maturity ladder can differ \\nbetween the going-concern approach and the two crisis scenarios, as shown in Table 2. In \\nconstructing the going-concern maturity ladder, conservative assumptions need to be made \\nabout the behaviour of cash flows that can replace the contractual cash flows. For example, \\nmany maturing loans would be rolled over in the normal course of business and some \\nproportion of transactions and savings deposits would also be rolled over or could be easily \\nreplaced. \\n In a bank-specific crisis scenario it is assumed that a bank will be unable to roll \\nover or replace many or most of its liabilities, and that it may have to wind down its books to \\nsome degree. The assumptions under the third scenario, a general market crisis, may differ \\nquite sharply from the assumptions made for a bank-specific crisis. For example, a bank may \\nbelieve, based upon its historical experience, that its ability to control the level and timing of \\nfuture cash flows from a stock of saleable assets in a bank-specific funding crisis would \\ndeteriorate little from normal conditions. However, in a general market crisis, this capacity \\nmay fall off sharply if few institutions are willing or able to make cash purchases of less \\nliquid assets. On the other hand, a bank that has a high reputation in the market may actually \\nbenefit from a flight to quality as potential depositors seek out the safest home for their funds. \\nBanks may also anticipate that central banks would ensure that key markets continue to \\nfunction but not necessarily without significant disruption. \\n \\n (iii) Measuring liquidity over the chosen time-frame \\n The evolution of a bank\\'s liquidity profile under one or more scenarios can be \\ntabulated or portrayed graphically, by cumulating the balance of expected cash inflows and \\ncash outflows at several time points. A stylised liquidity graph can be constructed enabling \\nthe evolution of the cumulative net excess or deficit of funds to be compared under the three \\nscenarios in order to provide further insights into a bank\\'s liquidity and to check how \\nconsistent and realistic the assumptions are for the individual bank. For example, a high-\\n \\n A later document on the same topic was published in February 2000. http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs69.htm \\n  \\n \\n page   \\n - 7 - \\n \\n quality institution may look very liquid in a going-concern scenario, marginally liquid in a \\nbank-specific crisis and quite liquid in a general market crisis. In contrast, a weaker institution \\nmight be far less liquid in the general crisis than it would in a bank-specific crisis. \\n It is important to note that the relevant time-frame for active liquidity \\nmanagement is short, generally extending out no more than a few weeks. While most banks \\nwould not actively manage their net funding requirements over a period much longer than \\nfour or five weeks, managements may consider information on requirements beyond that time \\nframe to be useful. Clearly, banks active in markets for longer-term assets and liabilities will \\nneed to use a longer time-frame than banks which are active in short-term money markets and \\nwhich are in a better position to fill funding gaps at short notice. However, even this latter \\ncategory of banks may find it worthwhile to tailor the maturity of new transactions to offset \\ngaps some time off. \\n A longer time horizon may also generate useful information on which to base \\nmore strategic decisions on the extent to which a bank may rely on particular markets. \\n \\n (iv) Assumptions used in determining cash flows \\n Since a bank\\'s future liquidity position will be affected by factors that cannot \\nalways be forecast with precision, assumptions need to be reviewed frequently to determine \\ntheir continuing validity, especially given the rapidity of change in banking markets. The total \\nnumber of major assumptions to be made, however, is fairly limited. This section attempts to \\ncatalogue the liquidity assumptions under four broad categories: (a) assets, (b) liabilities, \\n(c) off-balance-sheet activities, and (d) other. \\n \\n (a) Assets \\n Assumptions about a bank\\'s future stock of assets include their potential \\nmarketability and use as collateral of existing assets which could increase cash inflows, and \\nthe extent to which maturing assets will be renewed, and new assets acquired, thus reducing \\ncontractual cash inflows. \\n Determining the level of a bank\\'s potential assets involves answering three \\nquestions: \\n \\n • what proportion of maturing assets will a bank be able and willing to roll over or \\nrenew? \\n \\n • what is the expected level of new loan requests that will be accepted? \\n• what is the expected level of draw-downs of commitments to lend that a bank will \\n \\n need to fund? These commitments may take the form of committed commercial \\nlines without material adverse change (MAC) clauses, which a bank may not be \\nlegally able to turn away even if the borrower\\'s financial condition has \\ndeteriorated; committed commercial lines with MAC clauses which some \\ncustomers could draw down in crisis scenarios; and other commercial and \\nconsumer credit lines. \\n \\n A later document on the same topic was published in February 2000. http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs69.htm \\n  \\n \\n page   \\n - 8 - \\n \\n In estimating its normal funding needs, some banks use historical patterns of roll-overs, draw-\\ndowns and new requests for loans; others conduct a statistical analysis taking account of \\nseasonal and other effects believed to determine loan demand (e.g., for consumer loans). \\nAlternatively, a bank may make judgmental business projections, or undertake a customer-by-\\ncustomer assessment for its larger customers and apply historical relationships to the \\nremainder. \\n Roll-overs, draw-downs and new loan requests all represent potential cash drains \\nfor a bank. Nevertheless, a bank has some leeway to control many of these items depending \\non the assumed scenario. In a crisis situation, for example, a bank might decide to risk \\ndamaging some business relationships by refusing to roll over loans that it would make under \\nnormal conditions, or it might refuse to honour lending commitments that are not binding. \\n In determining the marketability of assets, the approach segregates the assets into \\nthree categories by their degree of relative liquidity: \\n \\n • the most liquid category includes components such as cash, securities, and \\ninterbank loans. Some of these assets may be immediately convertible into cash at \\nprevailing market values under almost any scenario (either by outright sale, or for \\nsale and repurchase, or as collateral for secured financing), while others, such as \\ninterbank loans or some securities, may lose liquidity in a general crisis; \\n \\n • a less liquid category comprises a bank\\'s saleable loan portfolio. The task here is \\nto develop assumptions about a reasonable schedule for the disposal of a bank\\'s \\nassets. Some assets, while marketable, may be viewed as unsaleable within the \\ntime frame of the liquidity analysis; \\n \\n • the least liquid category includes essentially unmarketable assets such as loans not \\ncapable of being readily sold, bank premises and investments in subsidiaries, as \\nwell as, possibly, severely troubled credits; \\n \\n • assets pledged to third parties are deducted from each category. \\n The view underlying the classification process is that different banks could assign \\nthe same asset to different categories on the maturity ladder because of differences in their \\ninternal asset-liability management. For example, a loan categorised by one bank as a \\nmoderately liquid asset - saleable only late in the liquidity analysis time-frame - may be \\nconsidered a candidate for fairly quick and certain liquidation at a bank that operates in a \\nmarket where loans are frequently transferred, that routinely includes loan-sale clauses in all \\nloan documentation and that has developed a network of customers with whom it has \\nconcluded loan-purchase agreements. \\n In categorising assets, a bank would also have to decide how an asset\\'s liquidity \\nwould be affected under different scenarios. Some assets that may be very liquid during times \\nof normal business conditions may be less so during a time of crisis. Consequently, a bank \\nmay place an asset in different categories depending on the type of scenario it is forecasting. \\n \\n A later document on the same topic was published in February 2000. http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs69.htm \\n  \\n \\n page   \\n - 9 - \\n \\n (b) Liabilities \\n To evaluate the cash flows arising from a bank\\'s liabilities, a bank would first \\nexamine the behaviour of its liabilities under normal business conditions. This would include \\nestablishing: \\n \\n • the normal level of roll-overs of deposits and other liabilities; \\n• the effective maturity of deposits with non-contractual maturities, such as demand \\n \\n deposits and many types of savings accounts; \\n• the normal growth in new deposit accounts. \\n \\n  As in assessing roll-overs and new requests for loans, a bank could use several \\npossible techniques to establish the effective maturities of its liabilities, such as using \\nhistorical patterns of deposit behaviour. For sight deposits, whether of individuals or \\nbusinesses, many banks conduct a statistical analysis that takes account of seasonal factors, \\ninterest rate sensitivities, and other macroeconomic factors. For some large wholesale \\ndepositors, a bank may undertake a customer-by-customer assessment of the probability of \\nroll-over. \\n In examining the cash flows arising from a bank\\'s liabilities in the two crisis \\nscenarios, a bank would examine four basic questions: \\n \\n • which sources of funding are likely to stay with a bank under any circumstance, \\nand can these be increased? \\n \\n • which sources of funding can be expected to run off gradually if problems arise, \\nand at what rate? Is deposit pricing a means of controlling the rate of runoff? \\n \\n • which maturing liabilities or liabilities with non-contractual maturities can be \\nexpected to run off immediately at the first sign of trouble? Are there liabilities \\nwith early withdrawal options that are likely to be exercised? \\n \\n • does the bank have back-up facilities that it can draw down? \\n The first two categories represent cash-flow developments that tend to reduce the \\ncash outflows projected directly from contractual maturities. In addition to the liabilities \\nidentified above, a bank\\'s capital and term liabilities not maturing within the horizon of the \\nliquidity analysis provide a liquidity buffer. \\n The liabilities that make up the first category may be thought to stay with a bank, \\neven under a \"worst-case\" projection. Some core deposits generally stay with a bank because \\nretail and small business depositors may rely on the public-sector safety net to shield them \\nfrom loss, or because the cost of switching banks, especially for some business services such \\nas transactions accounts, is prohibitive in the very short run. \\n The second category, liabilities that are likely to stay with a bank during periods \\nof mild difficulties and to run off relatively slowly in a crisis, includes core deposits that are \\nnot already included in the first category. In addition to core deposits, in some countries, \\nsome level of particular types of interbank and government funding may remain with a bank \\nduring such periods, although interbank and government deposits are often viewed as volatile. \\n \\n A later document on the same topic was published in February 2000. http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs69.htm \\n  \\n \\n page   \\n - 10 - \\n \\n A bank\\'s own liability roll-over experience as well as the experiences of other troubled \\ninstitutions should help in developing a timetable for these cash flows. \\n The third category comprises the remainder of the maturing liabilities, including \\nsome without contractual maturities, such as wholesale deposits. Under each scenario, this \\napproach adopts a conservative stance and assumes that these remaining liabilities are repaid \\nat the earliest possible maturity, especially in crisis scenarios, because such money may flow \\nto government securities and other safe havens. Factors such as diversification and \\nrelationship building are seen as especially important in evaluating the extent of liability run-\\noff and a bank\\'s capacity to replace funds. Nevertheless, in a general market crisis, some high-\\nquality institutions may find that they receive larger-than-usual wholesale deposit inflows, \\neven as funding inflows dry up for other market participants. \\n Some banks, for example, smaller banks in regional markets, may also have credit \\nlines that they can draw down to offset cash outflows. While these sorts of facility are \\nsomewhat rare among larger banks, the possible use of such lines could be addressed with a \\nbank\\'s liability assumptions. Where such facilities are subject to material adverse change \\nclauses, of course they may be of limited value, especially in a bank specific crisis. \\n \\n (c) Off-balance-sheet activities \\n A bank should also examine the potential for substantial cash flows from its off-\\nbalance-sheet activities (other than the loan commitments already considered), even if such \\ncash flows are not always a part of banks\\' current liquidity analysis. \\n Contingent liabilities, such as letters of credit and financial guarantees, represent \\npotentially significant cash drains for a bank, but are usually not dependent on a bank\\'s \\ncondition. A bank may be able to ascertain a \"normal\" level of cash outflows on an ongoing \\nconcern basis, and then estimate the scope for an increase in these flows during periods of \\nstress. However, a general market crisis may trigger a substantial increase in the amount of \\ndraw-downs of letters of credit because of an increase in defaults and bankruptcies in the \\nmarket. \\n Other potential sources of cash outflows include swaps, written over-the-counter \\n(OTC) options, and other interest rate and forward foreign exchange rate contracts. If a bank \\nhas a large swap book, for example, then it would want to consider the circumstances under \\nwhich the bank could become a net payer, and whether or not the potential net payout is \\nsignificant. For example, if a bank is a swap market-maker, the possibility exists that in a \\nbank-specific or general market crisis, customers with in-the-money swaps (or a net in-the-\\nmoney swap position) would seek to reduce their credit exposure to the bank by asking the \\nbank to buy back swaps. Similarly, a bank would need to review its written OTC options \\nbook and any outstanding warrants, together with any hedges against these positions, since \\ncertain types of crises may stimulate an increase in early exercises (for American-style \\noptions) or requests that the bank repurchase options. These exercises and repurchase requests \\n \\n A later document on the same topic was published in February 2000. http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs69.htm \\n  \\n \\n page   \\n - 11 - \\n \\n could result in an unforeseen cash drain, if hedges either cannot be quickly liquidated to \\ngenerate cash or provide insufficient cash. \\n \\n (d) Other assumptions \\n The discussion has centred so far on assumptions concerning the behaviour of \\nspecific instruments under various scenarios. Looking solely at instruments, however, may \\nignore some factors that may significantly impact a bank\\'s cash flows. \\n Besides the liquidity needs arising from business activities, banks also require \\nexcess funds to support other operations. For example, many large banks provide clearing \\nservices to correspondent banks and financial institutions that generate significant and not \\nalways easily predictable cash inflows and outflows, the amounts of which depend on the \\nclearing volumes of the correspondent banks. Unforeseen fluctuations in these volumes can \\ndeplete a bank of needed funds. \\n Net overhead expenses, such as rent and salary, although generally not significant \\nenough to be considered in banks\\' liquidity analyses, can in some cases also be sources of \\ncash outflows. \\n \\n B. Managing market access \\n \\n  Some liquidity management techniques are viewed as important not only for their \\ninfluence on the assumptions used in constructing the maturity ladders, but also for their \\ndirect contribution to enhancing a bank\\'s liquidity. Thus, it is important for a bank to review \\nperiodically its efforts to maintain the diversification of liabilities, to establish relationships \\nwith liability-holders and to develop asset-sales markets. \\n As a check for adequate diversification of liabilities, a bank needs to examine the \\nlevel of reliance on individual funding sources, by instrument type, nature of the provider of \\nfunds, and geographic market. In addition, a bank should strive to understand and evaluate \\nthe use of intercompany financing for its individual business offices. \\n Building strong relationships with some providers of funding can provide a line of \\ndefence in a liquidity problem and form an integral part of a bank\\'s liquidity management. \\nThe frequency of contact and the frequency of use of a funding source are two possible \\nindicators of the strength of a funding relationship. \\n Developing markets for asset sales or exploring arrangements under which a bank \\ncan borrow against assets is the third element of managing market access. The inclusion of \\nloan-sale clauses in loan documentation and the frequency of use of some asset-sales markets \\nare two possible indicators of a bank\\'s ability to execute asset sales under adverse scenarios. \\n \\n C. Contingency planning \\n \\n  A bank\\'s ability to withstand a net funding requirement in a bank specific or \\ngeneral market liquidity crisis can also depend on the calibre of its formal contingency plans. \\nEffective contingency plans should address two major questions: \\n \\n A later document on the same topic was published in February 2000. http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs69.htm \\n  \\n \\n page   \\n - 12 - \\n \\n • does management have a strategy for handling a crisis? \\n• does management have procedures in place for accessing cash in emergency? \\n \\n The degree to which a bank has addressed these questions realistically, provides management \\nwith additional insight as to how a bank may fare in a crisis. \\n \\n (i) Strategy \\n A game plan for dealing with a crisis should consist of several components. Most \\nimportant are those that involve managerial coordination. A contingency plan needs to spell \\nout procedures to ensure that information flows remain timely and uninterrupted, and that the \\ninformation flows provide senior management with the precise information it needs in order \\nto make quick decisions. A clear division of responsibility must be set out so that all \\npersonnel understand what is expected of them during a crisis. Confusion in this area can \\nwaste resources on certain issues and omit coverage on others. \\n Another major element in the plan should be a strategy for taking certain actions \\nto alter asset and liability behaviours. While assumptions can be made as to how an asset or \\nliability will behave under certain conditions (as discussed above), a bank may have the \\nability to change these characteristics. For example, a bank may conclude that it will suffer a \\nliquidity deficit in a crisis based on its assumptions regarding the amount of future cash \\ninflows from saleable assets and outflows from deposit run-offs. During such a crisis, \\nhowever, a bank may be able to market assets more aggressively, or sell assets that it would \\nnot have sold under normal conditions and thus augment its cash inflows from asset sales. \\nAlternatively, it may try to reduce cash outflows by raising its deposit rates to retain deposits \\nthat might otherwise have moved elsewhere. \\n Other components of the game plan involve maintaining customer relationships \\nwith borrowers, trading and off-balance-sheet counterparties, and liability-holders. As the \\nintensity of a crisis increases, banks must often trade off relationships with some customers \\nfor liquidity in order to survive. By classifying borrowers and trading customers according to \\ntheir importance to the bank, a bank can determine which relationships it may need to forgo at \\ndifferent points in a crisis. At the same time, relationships with lenders become more \\nimportant in a crisis. If a bank\\'s strategy requires liability managers to maintain strong \\nongoing links with lenders and large liability-holders during periods of relative calm, the bank \\nwill be better positioned to secure sources of funds during emergencies. \\n An additional, pragmatic element that may be important is how a bank deals with \\nthe press and broadcast media. Astute public relations management can help a bank avoid the \\nspread of public rumours that can result in significant run-offs by retail depositors and \\ninstitutional investors. \\n \\n (ii) Back-up liquidity \\n Contingency plans should also include procedures for making up cash flow \\nshortfalls in emergency situations. Banks have available to them several sources of such \\nfunds, including previously unused credit facilities and the domestic central bank. Depending \\n \\n A later document on the same topic was published in February 2000. http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs69.htm \\n  \\n \\n page   \\n - 13 - \\n \\n on the severity of a crisis, a bank may choose - or be forced - to use one or more of these \\nsources. The plan should spell out as clearly as possible the amount of funds a bank has \\navailable from these sources, and under what scenarios a bank could use them. \\n \\n A later document on the same topic was published in February 2000. http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs69.htm \\n  \\n \\n page   \\n - 14 - \\n \\n Table 1 \\nThe maturity ladder based on contractual maturities \\n \\n  \\nDAY 1: \\nCash Inflows \\n \\n   \\nCash Outflows \\n \\n   \\nExcess/(Shortfall) \\n \\n Maturing assets  100 \\nMaturing liabilities with \\ncontractual maturities  50 \\n \\n  \\n \\n Interest receivable  20 Interest payable  10  \\nAsset sales  50 Other deposit runoffs  30  \\nDrawdowns on Com.
